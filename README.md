# Spotify_Data_Mining
For our spotify.py program to run, search spotify developer on the web and create an account. Afterwards, on your creator dashboard, under settings, Spotify will provide you with the following details that you should paste in the Spotify.py file under the Authentication/Authorization section: cid, secret, redirect_uri, and username. From there, when you run our code, you will be able to get the results that we got.

disclaimer: the redirect_uri doesn't really work, it is just Spotify's way of authenticating you. Just make sure after you run your code, you are redirected to a seprate page where Spotify asks you to confirm your identity. Also, do not share the secret. 
It is also important to note that the top twenty tracks we extracted from this playlist are constantly being updated by Spotify, therefore the following tracks shown on report were taken from the week of May 3 and are subject to change resulting in different data if program is ran at a later time.
