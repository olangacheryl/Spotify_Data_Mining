# Spotify_Data_Mining
Our project's goal is to perform sentiment analysis on the lyrics of the top 20 tracks from a specified Spotify playlist. We utilize the Spotify and Genius APIs to gather the required data. The sentiment analysis is conducted using TextBlob. The script then saves the results to a CSV file and plots the sentiment analysis using seaborn and matplotlib. 

The ultimate purpose of our project is to provide insight into the emotional content of the most popular songs being listened to in America. This could be useful for various purposes, such as understanding the emotional context of the current music trends or for creating playlists with specific emotional tones.
